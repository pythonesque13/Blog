 **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** are two key concepts in artificial intelligence. While **Deep Learning** is part of **Machine Learning**, it has specific features that set it apart and allow it to solve more complex problems.

In this article, we will examine **the differences between ML and DL**, how they work, and their respective applications.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Definition of Machine Learning and Deep Learning

### üìå What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning (ML)**, or **machine learning**, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

- It uses **mathematical algorithms** to identify patterns in data.
- It requires **manual preprocessing** of features (**feature engineering**).
- It is divided into **supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning**.

**Examples of algorithms in ML**:
- Linear and logistic regression
- Decision trees and random forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means and clustering

### üìå What is Deep Learning?
**Deep Learning (DL)**, or **deep learning**, is a subcategory of Machine Learning that uses **artificial neural networks** inspired by the human brain.

- It can learn **directly** from raw data (e.g. images, sounds, texts) without requiring feature engineering.
- It works particularly well with **large amounts of data and high computing power**.
- It uses **deep neural networks (DNN)** composed of several hidden layers.

**Examples of DL algorithms**:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for computer vision.
- Recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM) for natural language processing.
- Transformers (BERT, GPT) for text generation.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Key differences between Machine Learning and Deep Learning

| Criterion | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | Machine learning based on statistical algorithms. | Uses deep neural networks for learning. |
| **Data-dependent** | Can work with small amounts of data. | Requires **large amounts** of data to be effective. |
| **Preprocessing** | **Manual** feature engineering required. | Automatically learns features from raw data. |
| **Computing Power** | Runs well on standard **CPUs**. | Requires **GPUs** or **TPUs** for intensive parallel computing. |
| **Interpretability** | Easily understandable and explainable. | Black box: difficult to interpret and explain. |
| **Training Time** | Usually fast. | Can be very long depending on the complexity of the model. |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ How to choose between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?
The choice between **ML and DL** depends on several factors:

- **Amount of available data**:
- Little data ‚ûù **Machine Learning**.
- Lots of data ‚ûù **Deep Learning**.

- **Complexity of the problem**:
- Simple and interpretable models ‚ûù **Machine Learning**.
- Tasks requiring automatic feature extraction ‚ûù **Deep Learning**.

- **Computing power**:
- Standard computer ‚ûù **Machine Learning**.
- GPU/TPU required ‚ûù **Deep Learning**.

## Conclusion
**Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** are two complementary approaches to artificial intelligence.

- **Machine Learning** is often sufficient for typical tasks and is more interpretable.
- **Deep Learning** excels at complex problems requiring **large amounts of data** and **high computing power**.

If you are new to AI, start with **Machine Learning**, then explore **Deep Learning** once you have mastered the basics. üöÄ
