Web programming is an exciting and accessible field, but to get started, it is important to acquire some essential basics. This article aims to guide beginners by explaining the prerequisites necessary to effectively launch into web development.

## 1. Understand how the web works
Before starting to code, it is essential to understand how the web works:
- **Browser and server**: interaction between clients (browsers) and servers.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: communication protocols.
- **Domains and hosting**: how a site is accessible online.

## 2. Master the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
### ðŸ”¹ HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the language used to structure a web page. It defines the elements of the page such as titles, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

Simple example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My first site</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
<p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### ðŸ”¹ CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style web pages, by defining colors, fonts, the arrangement of elements, etc.

Simple example:
```css
body {
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
background-color: #f4f4f4;
}
h1 {
color: blue;
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages, such as animations, form validations, etc.

Simple example:
```javascript
document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', function() {
alert('You clicked on the title!');
});
```

## 3. Learn the basics of programming
Before exploring advanced frameworks, it is useful to understand:
- Variables and data types (string, number, boolean).
- Conditions (`if`, `else`).
- Loops (`for`, `while`).
- Functions.

## 4. Get familiar with essential tools
- **Code editor**: VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
- **Browser with development tools**: Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Edition.
- **Version management**: Git and GitHub to save and share your code.

## 5. Explore frameworks and libraries
Once you have learned the basics, you can learn:
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, React.js, Vue.js.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django, Laravel.
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

## Conclusion
Learning web programming requires patience and practice. By mastering these prerequisites, you will be well prepared to begin your adventure in web development.
