Django is a web framework written in Python that allows you to develop robust, secure, and scalable applications. Designed to make it easy to create websites and APIs, it is based on the **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** principle and offers a set of built-in tools for rapid development.

This guide will help you learn Django quickly and adopt best practices for efficient and maintainable code.

---

## 1. What is Django?
Django is a **full-stack web framework** for Python, which includes everything you need to create a complete web application.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features** :
- **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database
- Built-in authentication system
- Automatic administration interface
- Enhanced security against common attacks (CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection)

ðŸ“Œ Django is used by large companies like Instagram, Pinterest and Mozilla.

## 2. Learn Django fast ðŸš€
### ðŸ”¹ 1. Install Django and create a project
Make sure you have Python installed, then use **pip** to install Django:
```bash
pip install django
```

Create a new Django project:
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver
```
Your application is now accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Understand MVT architecture
Django follows the **MVT (Model - View - Template)** pattern:
- **Model**: Manages the database.
- **View**: Contains the business logic.
- **Template (Template)** : Sets the page display.

Simple template example:
```python
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
content = models.TextField()
publication_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Create a Django app
In Django, a project can contain multiple apps. To create one:
```bash
python manage.py startapp blog
```
Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Configure routes and views
Define a route in `urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
path('', views.accueil, name='accueil'),
]
```
And create a view in `views.py`:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def accueil(request):
return render(request, 'accueil.html')
```

## 3. Best practices for efficient development âœ…
### ðŸ”¹ 1. Use a virtual environment
To isolate your project:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
```

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Structure your project properly
- Separate the **models.py**, **views.py**, **forms.py** and **services.py** files
- Use **explicit names** for variables and functions
- Organize **templates** and **static files** in dedicated folders

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Secure your application
- Never expose **SECRET_KEY** (`.env` recommended with `django-environ`)
- Always enable `DEBUG=False` in production
- Use `django.contrib.auth` for user management

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Optimize the database
- Use **select_related() and prefetch_related()** to avoid unnecessary SQL queries
- Add **indexes on frequently used columns**
- Enable **caching** with `django-cache`

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Test your code
Django integrates a testing framework:
```bash
python manage.py test
```
Use **pytest-django** for more advanced testing.

## Conclusion
Django is a powerful framework that allows fast and secure development of web applications. By following the steps described and applying best practices, you will be able to create robust and scalable projects. ðŸš€
