**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, decision-making, and machine learning. Today, AI is ubiquitous, whether in virtual assistants, self-driving cars, or online content recommendations.

In this article, we will explore the evolution of AI, its different approaches, and its impact on our society.

## 1️⃣ The origins of Artificial Intelligence

### 📌 Philosophical foundations
The idea of ​​an **intelligent machine** dates back to Antiquity with philosophical myths and concepts:
- **Antiquity**: Legends of animated statues and automatons in ancient Greece.
- **17th century**: Descartes imagines that animals and humans function like machines.
- **1854**: George Boole formalizes Boolean logic, the basis of modern computer calculations.

### 📌 The rise of computing and early research (1940-1950)
AI becomes a subject of study with advances in mathematics and computer science:
- **1943**: McCulloch & Pitts develop the first artificial neuron model.
- **1950**: Alan Turing proposes the famous **Turing Test**, a criterion for evaluating the intelligence of a machine.

### 📌 Official birth of AI (1956)
At the **Dartmouth conference in 1956**, the term *Artificial Intelligence* is officially used by John McCarthy. This period marks the beginning of the first experiments on machine learning and problem-solving algorithms.
