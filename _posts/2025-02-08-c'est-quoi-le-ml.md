 **Machine Learning (ML)**, or **machine learning**, is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Through learning algorithms, machines can detect patterns, make predictions, and improve over time.

In this article, we will explore **the origin of ML, how it works, its applications, and how to get started**.

## 1️⃣ History and evolution of Machine Learning

The concept of machine learning was born with the rise of artificial intelligence.

### 📌 The beginnings of ML
- **1950**: Alan Turing publishes his article on AI and proposes the **Turing Test**.
- **1957**: Frank Rosenblatt develops the **Perceptron**, an artificial neuron model inspired by the human brain.
- **1980-1990**: Improvement of algorithms thanks to multi-layer neural networks.

### 📌 The rise of modern ML
- **2000-2010**: Development of **deep learning** algorithms.
- **2010-today**: Explosion of **Big Data**, improvement of computer hardware (GPU, TPU), and advances in **natural language processing (NLP)**.

## 2️⃣ How does Machine Learning work?
ML is based on three main categories of learning:

### 🔹 1. Supervised learning
- The algorithm learns from **labeled data**.
- Examples: image recognition, email classification (spam vs. non-spam).
- Common algorithms: **Linear regression, Decision trees, SVM, Neural networks**.

### 🔹 2. Unsupervised learning
- The algorithm discovers **hidden patterns** without labels.
- Examples: customer segmentation in marketing, anomaly detection.
- Common algorithms: **K-Means, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Autoencoders**.

### 🔹 3. Reinforcement learning
- An agent learns by **trial and error**, by receiving **rewards or penalties**.
- Examples: AlphaGo (Go game), autonomous cars.
- Common algorithms: **Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.

## 3️⃣ Machine Learning Applications
Machine Learning is used in many fields:

### ✅ **Health**
- Early detection of diseases (e.g. cancer, heart disease).
- Medical image analysis (X-rays, MRI).

### ✅ **Finance**
- Bank fraud detection.
- Stock market trend prediction.

### ✅ **Marketing and recommendations**
- Personalized suggestions (Netflix, Amazon, Spotify).
- Customer segmentation for ad targeting.

### ✅ **Natural language processing (NLP)**
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa).
- Machine translation (Google Translate).
- Text generation (ChatGPT, BERT).

### ✅ **Transport and robotics**
- Self-driving cars (Tesla, Waymo).
- Route optimization in logistics.

## 4️⃣ How to get started in Machine Learning?

### 🔹 1. Learn programming
- **Python** is the most used language in ML.
- Key libraries: **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras**.

### 🔹 2. Acquire basics in mathematics
- **Linear algebra** (matrices, vectors).
- **Probability and statistics**.
- **Differential calculus** (for model training).

### 🔹 3. Experiment with datasets
- **Kaggle**: ML challenge platform.
- **Google Colab**: online environment to run ML code.
- **Public datasets**: MNIST (handwritten digits), CIFAR-10 (images), IMDB (texts).

### 🔹 4. Build projects
- Create an **image classifier**.
- Build a **real estate price prediction model**.
- Develop an **NLP chatbot**.
