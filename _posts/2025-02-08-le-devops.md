## 1Ô∏è‚É£ The fundamentals of DevOps

DevOps is based on several essential principles:

### üîπ 1. Collaboration and communication
- Reduction of silos between development and operations teams.
- Better coordination of processes and responsibilities.

### üîπ 2. Process automation
- Automation of **deployment, testing and monitoring**.
- Use of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Deployment) scripts and tools.

### üîπ 3. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)
- Rapid integration of code with automated tests.
- Frequent and reliable deployments to production.

### üîπ 4. Monitoring and feedback
- Collection of performance metrics.
- Continuous adjustment to optimize efficiency.
