<h3 id="-what-is-machine-learning">📌 What is Machine Learning?</h3>
<p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>, or <strong>machine learning</strong>, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows machines to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It uses <strong>mathematical algorithms</strong> to identify patterns in data.</li>
  <li>It requires <strong>manual preprocessing</strong> of features (<strong>feature engineering</strong>).</li>
  <li>It is divided into <strong>supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of algorithms in ML</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linear and logistic regression</li>
  <li>Decision trees and random forests</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
  <li>K-Means and clustering</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-what-is-deep-learning">📌 What is Deep Learning?</h3>
<p><strong>Deep Learning (DL)</strong>, or <strong>deep learning</strong>, is a subcategory of Machine Learning that uses <strong>artificial neural networks</strong> inspired by the human brain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can learn <strong>directly</strong> from raw data (e.g. images, sounds, texts) without requiring feature engineering.</li>
  <li>It works particularly well with <strong>large amounts of data and high computing power</strong>.</li>
  <li>It uses <strong>deep neural networks (DNN)</strong> composed of several hidden layers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of DL algorithms</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for computer vision.</li>
  <li>Recurrent neural networks (RNN, LSTM) for natural language processing.</li>

  <li>Data journalism (automatic generation of financial and sports reports).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-the-limits-of-ai">📌 The limits of AI</h3>
<p>However, AI has significant limitations that make its total replacement of humans unlikely:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lack of consciousness and emotions</strong>: AI cannot feel or interpret human emotions like a human being.</li>
  <li><strong>Data dependency</strong>: AI works on past data, which limits its capacity for spontaneous innovation.</li>
  <li><strong>Need for human supervision</strong>: human supervision and interpretation remain crucial for AI.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-towards-human-machine-collaboration">📌 Towards human-machine collaboration</h3>
<p>Rather than replacing humans, AI tends to <strong>assist</strong> them by improving productivity and eliminating certain repetitive tasks. Jobs will evolve towards <strong>collaboration</strong> between humans and artificial intelligence, creating new opportunities.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> has come a long way, from the first philosophical ideas to today’s advanced models. Thanks to advances in <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and <strong>massive access to data</strong>, AI continues to revolutionize our daily lives.</p>

<p>Its development has also opened the door to many professional opportunities, giving rise to specialized professions in the design, analysis and ethics of AI. Although AI can automate certain tasks, its total replacement of humans remains unlikely due to its fundamental limitations.</p>

This article aims to guide beginners by explaining the prerequisites necessary to effectively launch into web development.</p>

<h2 id="1-understand-how-the-web-works">1. Understand how the web works</h2>
<p>Before starting to code, it is essential to understand how the web works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Browser and server</strong>: interaction between clients (browsers) and servers.</li>
  <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS</strong>: communication protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Domains and hosting</strong>: how a site is accessible online.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-master-the-basics-of-html-css-and-javascript">2. Master the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
<h3 id="-html-hypertext-markup-language">🔹 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
<p>HTML is the language used to structure a web page. It defines the elements of the page such as titles, paragraphs, images, links, etc.</p>

<p>Simple example:</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>My first site<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Welcome to my site<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is my first paragraph.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
